# Online Payment Fraud Detection

## Overview
Online payment fraud detection involves using machine learning models to identify and classify fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. By analyzing historical transaction data, we aim to understand patterns and behaviors that indicate fraud and build a predictive model to detect fraudulent activities in real-time.

## Dataset Information
For this project, we use a dataset collected from Kaggle, which contains historical information about online payment transactions. The dataset includes details of both fraudulent and legitimate transactions, allowing us to train and evaluate our model effectively. Below are the columns from the dataset:

- **step**: Represents a unit of time, where 1 step equals 1 hour.
- **type**: Type of online transaction.
- **amount**: The amount of the transaction.
- **nameOrig**: Customer initiating the transaction.
- **oldbalanceOrg**: Balance before the transaction.
- **newbalanceOrig**: Balance after the transaction.
- **nameDest**: Recipient of the transaction.
- **oldbalanceDest**: Initial balance of the recipient before the transaction.
- **newbalanceDest**: New balance of the recipient after the transaction.
- **isFraud**: Indicates whether the transaction is fraudulent (1 for fraud, 0 for non-fraud).
  

## Steps to Detect Fraud
1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: Analyze the dataset to understand its structure and clean any inconsistencies or missing values.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create or modify features that help in improving model performance.
3. **Data Splitting**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the modelâ€™s effectiveness.
4. **Model Selection**: Train various machine learning models such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting classifiers.
5. **Evaluation**: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
6. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model for real-time fraud detection in online payment systems.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost
- **Dataset Source**:(Historical transaction data)

## Conclusion
This project provides a systematic approach to identifying fraudulent online payment transactions using machine learning. By leveraging historical data and advanced algorithms, we can enhance the security and reliability of digital payment systems, protecting users from financial fraud.
